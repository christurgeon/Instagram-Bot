# instagram-bot
This script has a comment, like, and follow mode. It logs in with account credentials and accesses posts based on a hashtag of choice or a username of choice and finds other accounts to interact with.

Need to download chromedriver.exe and place it in the same location as the script.

NOTE: If the program breaks while trying to navigate Instagram, then most likely Instagram has updated their website and the HTML parsing with Selenium needs to be changed.
